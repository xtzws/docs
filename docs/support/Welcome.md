# Welcome

This section has tutorials for common and uncommon problems that come up in tech. In reality, it's mainly more so that if I have to do complex setup again, I don't have to spend 10 hours diagnosing an issue I've already solved.

So especially in VPS, the instructions are really specific and probably don't work for what you're trying to accomplish, but they might help with the issue you have.

On the server, I think I deal exclusively with Open Source software, including:
- Plausible
- Apache HTTPd
- OpenLiteSpeed
- Docker Mailserver
- Listmonk
- WordPress
- MySQL Server
- Postgres
