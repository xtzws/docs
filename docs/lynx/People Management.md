# People Management
Ideally, the only people in the timing area are the timers. This is almost never the case because coaches will often pick up their packets from this area simply because it is more convenient for everyone. You should never allow spectators or athletes in this area.

If possible, tape off this area. If anyone tries to come in, you don't need to hear their reason of "Oh, I'm not going far" "I'm just passing through" "I'll be careful". Not important. You tell them they can't cross here, cross on the other side. If they continue to protest, call over a more formidable adult.

There should be just three exceptions to this rule:
1. The timers
2. Coaches picking up their packet or making roster modifications
3. A person who can produce a cashier's or certified check for 18 grand, is prepared to tell everyone assembled at the meet why the races are canceled or delayed, and is prepared to potentially face criminal charges
