# Equipment Setup

To know what equipment you need, check out the [Equipment Checklist](./equipment-checklist/).
## EtherLynx Pro
Attach the EtherLynx Pro camera to the Remote Tilt plate and screw it on. The ports on the plate should be on the left side when facing the camera from the front. Attach the Remote Tilt plate to the Ether Pro tripod plate, then snap in the plate to the actual tripod legs. Extend the legs all the way out. Adjust the tripod as needed to be perpendicular to the finish line and far enough away to see all of the runners.

Connect the black serial cord from the camera to the front port on the Remote Tilt. Take the second gray serial cord and connect from the Remote Control port on the back of the camera into the back port on the Remote Tilt.

Take the second longest Ethernet cable and plug it into the the back of the camera in the POE port. The other end goes into the black Ethernet adapter. Ensure that the leftmost port stays open.

If it's windy, take the orange tie downs and loop it through a 45lb plate, then finesse it through the tripod legs and hook to weigh it down. It's perfectly fine to hang from the bottom, as long as as much weight as possible is pulling the camera down rather than just having it sit on the ground like it was before.

Cover the camera with the included purple rain cover.
## IdentiLynx
Attach the IndentiLynx camera to the IndentiLynx tripod.

Connect the longest POE cable to the back of the camera and put the other end into the Ethernet hub. Ensure the leftmost port stays open.

Extend the legs all the way out. Position the camera so that you have as close to a head-on view of the runners as you can get. In other words, move it about 30-50ft away from the Ether Pro camera in the same direction that the athletes run.
## Generator
Instructions are on the machine.

Make sure all plugs are empty. Choke the engine, pull the cord until it starts, unchoke the engine. You can now plug everything in. Plug a power strip into here.
## RadioLynx and Wireless Start

You can see the battery percentage remaining on the EncRadio by pressing the "ON/OFF" button once

Find the two wireless start devices, the DecRadio and EncRadio (both labeled as such). Screw on the gray antennae to both devices into the coax port on the top.  On the DecRadio, plug in the black cord to the RadioLynx port on the back of the Ether Pro camera. Attach it to the tripod with the zip tie on the back and the little metal carabiner. It's perfectly fine for the antenna to be pointed down.

On the EncRadio, plug in the banana plugs into the matching color ports on the bottom of the sensor. Attach the red start sensor to the end of this. To turn it on, hold the ON/OFF button on the bottom right. Find out how to test it in [RadioLynx](./software-setup/#radiolynx).

Find the weird foam-wrapped nunchuck device with a red button on the top labeled as Remote Capture. You don’t need to plug the USB end into the laptop running FinishLynx, but when you run FinishLynx, it will give you an error saying "Capture Button not plugged in" or something like that. Since we use automatic capture, this isn’t a big deal.
## Ethernet hub
In Port 5, plug the third POE cable from the hub to the ethernet port on the laptop. Plug the power cord into the power strip. My standard practice is to connect the Ether Pro camera to port 1, then the IdentiLynx goes in port 2.
## Printer
If you need to print something, you can use the printer. Set the printer up on the table. Plug the USB-B end into the printer and the USB-A end into the laptop. Prepare your file to print on the laptop and select the Brother printer as the destination. If it does not appear, you will need to add it.

The printer prints double sided but you may need to install additional drivers from Brother. When printing, it will output one page on one side and you will follow the instructions to feed it back into the machine to print on the other side.
