# Software Management

## Alignment
After having set up all equipment it’s time to make sure it’s functional and works properly.

Before loading a race, both cameras need to be set up with EasyAlign.

Make sure that the finish line in real life is lined up with the vertical green line on the Ether Pro. The image that you see is likely to not be the entire image the camera captures so make sure to scroll to see the whole thing.

On the IdentiLynx, try to have it face as head-on to the runners as possible to have the best chance of seeing their bib or sticker number. In the camera settings, select the highest resolution and a frame rate of at about 1/15.

Before capturing or starting a race, make sure to select the 1260x920 resolution for the IdentiLynx. Despite my best attempts, this cannot be changed later, only at startup.

## Mixed races

This info was told to me after I asked the meet timers at the 2025 All City meet at HC. Shoutout to them.
:::
FinishLynx doesn't care who is in a race (or even if there are any runners at all) but Anet cares very much. If you run a combined race, like the 4x8, mile, or two mile, you don't need to manually port or type results.
1. In the schedule, save and close the first of the combined races (e.g. girls)
2. Arm and capture the actual event as the second event (e.g. boys)
3. After the boys have been entered, save but **don't close** the event
4. In the Results Zone, choose load from event (or whatever it's actually called)
5. After you've gone through and entered all the girls' times, save and close the event (you can ignore the warning that the file already exists)
:::danger Watch out
I've only tested this with RunMeet uploading live. It's very possible that if you upload manually after the meet, the boys will be missing (or vice versa)
