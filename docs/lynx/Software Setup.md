# Software Setup
## This can be done on any device ↓
### RunMeet
Log into Athletic.net with your Coach account. If you do not yet have one, contact the AD for help. Navigate to the meet you are timing or create one if it isn't there. Hover over the meet then click Manage Meet. Select the **RUNMEET** tab. If it isn't active yet, click the green **Start Now** button. RunMeet is now active and you can poke around here for whatever settings you need changed.

You can also add competitors, scratch them, or make other changes as long as you are online.

## This MUST be done on the laptop with the Ethernet hub ↓
### RunMeet Local
Open the RunMeet Local app.

Log in with your ANET Coach account. From the dropdown, select the meet you are timing. Open File Explorer and create a folder with the date and level of the event, preferable in the same parent folder as the other meets. In RunMeet Local, select this folder as the Schedule folder and the Results folder. Click Listen Live. RunMeet Local is now set up.

Listen Live requires a constant internet connection. If a constant connection is unavailable (either through the school Wifi or a hotspot), you can choose Manually Upload. An internet connection is required for initial set up.
### FinishLynx
Open FinishLynx.

Go to File > Options... > Event, then for Event Directory select the same folder you created for RunMeet Local. Now go to the Database tab and select the same folder again for the Input and Output Directory, then click Ok.

In the top left, select Load Event from the Schedule. Click Load Schedule, then in the dropdown select the first race. The race is now armed and ready to receive captures.
### RadioLynx
To make sure that RadioLynx and the Wireless Start System works, you need to test it. Ensure that you have followed all the steps in the [Equipment Setup](../equipment-setup/). Take the larger start sensor and bap the top of the red thing. In FinishLynx, you should hear a little bell and see a yellow box appear with the running time of the race. After confirming everything works correctly, you can pass the tripod and the start sensor off to the official who will be starting the race.

The sensor works from any reasonable distance (up to 2km away), and even if it doesn't transmit right away, you can have it rebroadcast the signal once you are closer with a timestamp so you can start capturing on FinishLynx after the race actually starts. The sensor gives off a faint beep once it has been activated.
