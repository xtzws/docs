# Domain Credits
Domain credits included with your plan can be redeemed for an actual domain. Because of the wide variety of prices (several of which I couldn't afford even if the entire Pro plan was spent on it) and to help you choose the right domain, I have instead assigned several top-level domains a credit value. You may mix-and-match your credits. For example, if you have five credits available, you can buy five one-credit domains or one five-credit domain, or three one-credit domains and one two-credit domain.

If you desire a top-level domain not listed here, you can request it and it will be evaluated. If you want a domain with a higher value than your plan, you will pay the difference (varies by domain). Credits apply to available, non-premium domains. You can see if the domain name you want is taken by checking with [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/en/).
