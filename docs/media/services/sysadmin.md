# Sysadmin
"System administrator." Need a custom server managed? I can procure and maintain applications and servers on your behalf, including enterprise software. This includes web and game servers (like Minecraft), Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, or bring-your-own and I provide hosting!

## Enterprise
This would effectively be like me being the IT guy. I would work with you to determine what would allow you to streamline your operations and integrate with your current systems. I would set up and integrate enterprise solutions like Microsoft, Atlassian, and Google Workspace.

## Isaac on the Server
If you need, have, or want a private server with private resources managed for you, this may be the service you're looking for. Servers come with advanced control and security over shared solutions, but the expertise needed to install and maintain these servers can be prohibitive.

Servers are also a great choice if you need specialized software in your operations. Often with web hosting, you have the choice of PHP and Javascript, but if you need software to be installed or other languages like Python or Rust, your web host would not allow that. Renting a server is a low-cost option that comes with dedicated system resources and predictable pricing that doesn't fluctuate.

## Isaac in the Cloud
The cloud is a terrific option if you need something that can scale instantly to meet demand. Where a server would reach capacity, the cloud is endless. Many cloud providers also offer one-click install for thousands of applications that are tailored for maximum performance. Most plans are billed pay-as-you-go so you won't be charged for unused resources as with a traditional server.

Command line experience is still needed for cloud solutions. The sheer number of plans available from cloud providers can be overwhelming especially since seemingly a dozen of them do the exact same thing. Cloud solutions can be a great choice if you need flexibility and scalability.

## Gaming
Some games, like Minecraft, ARK, and Rust, allow you to run a server on your own device. This means you have more control over party limits, world settings, and mods. I can provide the server and maintenance for games that allow self-hosting a server.
