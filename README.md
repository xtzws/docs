# Docs for Isaacal Media

This repo has the source files for [docs.isaac.run](https://docs.isaac.run). To build them, you'll need Docusaurus and Node.js.

I'll update this at most once per week. Less if I don't feel like it or there aren't any changes.

Docusaurus is MIT licensed. Node.js is mostly MIT, but partly BSD, Apache, and a couple others. All of my documentation is CC BY-SA 4.0.
